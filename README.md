# Fictitious Yacht Club
## Codecademy project

    - basic html
    - basic css
    - basic @media use for screen sizing
    - use of java script
    - use of form elements
    - use of Git and GitHub
    - use of stock photos for backgrounds and so on

As a side note,  this is a learning project, one of my first. So it is bad.
